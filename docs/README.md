# OctoAcme Project Management Docs README

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme uses a structured, cross-functional project management framework that balances clear ownership, iterative delivery, and data-driven decisions. Our processes are documented to support consistency, reduce onboarding friction, and enable continuous improvement.

- **Projects begin with Initiation**, ensuring business needs, success metrics, and stakeholder alignment.
- **Planning** transforms approved ideas into actionable roadmaps, risk registers, and prioritized backlogs.
- **Execution & Tracking** uses collaborative boards, CI/CD best practices, and regular demos to guide delivery.
- **Risks & Communication** outlines how we identify, escalate, and communicate risks and dependencies to stakeholders at the right cadence.
- **Release & Deployment** provides step-by-step guides for shipping, rollback, and incident playbooks.
- **Retrospectives & Continuous Improvement** drive ongoing learning and process refinements.
- **Core Roles & Personas** clarify responsibilities and interactions across PM, Product, QA, stakeholders, and developers.
